# Get In Touch #

## Target Market ##
Professionals who want to stay in touch with their professional contacts (and friends) can use Get In Touch to remember
when to reach out to those contacts.

## Summary ##
Get In Touch helps you remember when to reach out to your contacts. Suppose you want to stay in contact with
Amie, who works at a company you might want to work at in the future; several former work colleagues; and some close
family members who live across the country. Get In Touch can remind you to follow up with each of them on a regular
basis. You can even use Get In Touch to save "stories" - updates about your life - and you can use those stories to
help you write messages when you follow up with your contacts. For example, you may want to contact Amie at least once
every six months. Get In Touch reminds you when it's time to contact her again. As you write a message to her, you
review your saved stories to help remind you of things you might want to tell Amie about. You also review notes you made
about Amie the last time you caught up, and you include a couple of questions about how her projects are going. In 18
months, when you are ready to apply for a job at Amie's company, she will be happy to recommend you.

## Problem ##
There isn't an easy way to keep track of your contacts, and how often you should contact each of them.

## Solution ##
Get In Touch allows you to save contacts, and reminds you when you should follow up with them again. GIT also makes it
easy to save notes about each contact, and save "stories" about your life to include when you follow up with them.

## Testimonials ##
"I never used to get around to staying in contact with most of my friends from high school and college. I felt like
a lot of them knew what was going on with each other, but I wasn't really in the loop. Now Get In Touch helps me
remember when to reach out to friends on Facebook. It's like having my old friend circle back again!"
