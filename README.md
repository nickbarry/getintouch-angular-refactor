# MVP (Solo) Project

## Basic Requirements
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
   - Create the ability to add new contacts, and update contacts' "last contacted" property.
   - Make sure the client/server are sending data between each other.
   - Connect to a database
   - Deploy to Heroku.
   - Optional: Create ability to save notes for each contact
   - Optional: Connect the server to Facebook, Gmail, and LinkedIn third party APIs.
   - Optional: Build the ability to save user "stories" (updates).
- [ ] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 
- [ ] Use Liberator, then deploy your app so the whole world can see!
- [ ] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.
