# MVP (Solo) Project

## Basic Requirements
- Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
    - Add a navbar:
        - Create the ability to add new contacts
        - See future contacts due (and maybe other filters)
    - Deploy to Heroku.
- Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday
- Work on more features:
    - Create ability to save notes for each contact
    - Ability to save user stories
    - Connect the server to Facebook, Gmail, and LinkedIn third party APIs.
    - Build the ability to save user "stories" (updates).
    - Ability to filter contacts by tag/keyword
    - Make sure the client/server are sending data between each other.
    - Connect to a database


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 
- [ ] Use Liberator, then deploy your app so the whole world can see!
- [ ] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.
