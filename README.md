# MVP (Solo) Project

## Basic Requirements
- Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
    - Add a navbar:
        - See future contacts due (and maybe other filters)
- Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday
    - Build the ability to save user "stories" (updates).
        - Ability to create new stories
- Work on more features:
    - Connect the server to Facebook, Gmail, and LinkedIn third party APIs.
    - Ability to filter contacts by tag/keyword
    - Make sure the client/server are sending data between each other.
    - Connect to a database
